TEMPFileRemover

Powershell script that removes TEMP files from Windows 7 &amp; Machines

This is one of my first scripts I have written in Powershell, as I recently started to use it at work. No previous programming experience.

I put this together so I can easily clean up TEMP files from my machines. Just run it as admin and it will check how many files you have in the folders specified, then clean them all up and empty the recycle bin.

It is still a bit work in progress however any comments would be nice.
